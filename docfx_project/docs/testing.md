# Testing Your Connector

To ensure the connector works as expected, implement a robust testing strategy. Use testing frameworks like xUnit or NUnit for unit and integration tests. Mock simulator interactions to isolate components during unit tests.

A comprehensive testing strategy for simulator connectors can include:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test interaction with the real simulator
3. **End-to-End Tests** - Test the full workflow with CDF
4. **Manual Testing** - Verify behavior with real models
