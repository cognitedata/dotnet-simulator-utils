### Error Handling and Logging
Implement proper error handling and logging throughout your connector. Use the ILogger interface for consistent logging.

A logger is available in the ISimulatorClient and can be accessed as follows:
```csharp
_logger.LogDebug("Your message here");
```

### Testing
Create unit tests for your connector to ensure it works as expected. 


By following these steps, you should be able to create a custom connector for your simulator that integrates with the Cognite simulator integration framework. Remember to adjust the code examples to fit your specific simulator's requirements and to handle any simulator-specific operations in the RunSimulation method of your ISimulatorClient implementation.
