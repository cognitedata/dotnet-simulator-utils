# .NET Simulator Utils for Cognite Data Fusion

The **.NET Simulator Utils** SDK simplifies creating simulator connectors that integrate industrial simulators with Cognite Data Fusion (CDF).

For an overview of CDF's simulator capabilities, see [Simulators in CDF](https://docs.cognite.com/cdf/integration/guides/simulators/).

## Documentation

New to the SDK? **[Start here: Understanding Simulator Integration](./docs/understanding-integration.md)**
